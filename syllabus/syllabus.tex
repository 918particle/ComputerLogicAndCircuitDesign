\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The fundamental concepts of digital logic and digital circuit design are presented, both theoretically and in laboratory exercises.  In the beginning, core concepts like binary number systems, binary mathematics, and floating point representation are presented.  The concepts of Boolean logic and logic gates, truth tables, combinatorial logic and Karnaugh maps follow, all with corresponding laboratory demonstrations or exercises.  These core concepts prove useful in a wide range of engineering, business, and scientific situations.  Laboratory exercises are designed to provide hands-on experience with the physical implementation of digital logic gates and programmable logic.  Following an understanding of core modules, more complex digital elements are introduced.  Examples include flip-flops (memory elements), counters, registers and shift registers.  The course concludes with examples of digital systems useful for science and engineering, including binary adders (ALUs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), digital-to-analog converters (DACs), digital signal processing (DSP) of audio, and HDMI video.  Student-designed projects are created and presented near the end of the course that integrate programmable logic and peripheral devices that enrich the student experience.
